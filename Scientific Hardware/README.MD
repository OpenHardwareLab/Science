Scientific Hardware Category
Welcome to the Scientific Hardware Category in our OpenHardwareLab! This category is home to open-source hardware designs primarily used for scientific research and exploration. Here, you'll find designs ranging from laboratory equipment to field research tools and more.

What You'll Find Here
This directory encompasses hardware designs relevant to a variety of scientific domains, including but not limited to:

Laboratory equipment (microscopes, centrifuges, pipettes, etc.)
Data acquisition systems
Measurement and analysis tools
Field research equipment
Astronomy tools
Particle detection systems
Geology and meteorology equipment
Each design is contained in its own directory, which includes all necessary resources such as CAD files, schematics, BOM (Bill of Materials), assembly instructions, and any related software if applicable.

How to Contribute
Contributions from everyone are greatly appreciated. Whether you're a seasoned researcher, an engineer, a hobbyist, or a student, your designs and modifications can greatly impact scientific discovery.

Before contributing, please ensure you:

Review Existing Designs: Check that your design or improvement does not already exist in this repository. Use the search function to do so.

Create a New Branch: To contribute a design or suggest an improvement, please create a new branch using the following naming convention: <your-github-username>/<brief-description-of-your-design>. This keeps the master branch clean and your changes isolated until they are ready.

Add Your Design: Include all relevant files (schematics, CAD files, BOM, assembly instructions, etc.) and a detailed README.md file explaining your design, how to assemble it, and any other relevant information.

Submit a Pull Request: Once your design is complete, submit a pull request to merge your branch into the master branch. Include a comprehensive description of your design and any relevant information in the pull request.

Design Review: Your design will be reviewed by the community and the maintainer team. Address any comments or suggestions provided in the review before your design can be merged into the master branch.

Code of Conduct
Our goal is to foster an inclusive and respectful community. Please ensure your interactions respect our Code of Conduct.
